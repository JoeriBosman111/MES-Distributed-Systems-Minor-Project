# MES-Distributed-Systems-Minor-Project
Git Repository for all MES DS Minor Project Files

This repository contains a complete HANCoder folder. All software iterations are saved and appended with \_Vn, where n is the iteration based on chronological order.
In the "Target" folder the \_startup.m and .slx files can be found. For easiest implementation of this software, the entire repository is to be cloned onto the local drive or the computer, and open the desired file using MATLAB 2023a or later.
